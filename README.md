## Required Resources
### EMNIST Dataset
The EMNIST dataset is required to train the deep neural network. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.nist.gov/node/1298471/emnist-dataset).
The dataset comes in two formats, binary and matlab. Matlab is the format utilised by the training program and a download link for that version of the dataset can be found [here](http://www.itl.nist.gov/iaui/vip/cs_links/EMNIST/matlab.zip). 
Once downloaded, the .zip file can be extracted and the contents placed in the repo folder: */EMNIST/matlab/*.
